    1. First, add known faces using the left panel. You can upload images or take photos with your camera.
    2. Each person should have a clear, well-lit frontal face image.
    3. Once you've added known faces, use the camera on the right to take a photo for recognition.
    4. The app will identify known faces and mark unknown faces as "Unknown".
